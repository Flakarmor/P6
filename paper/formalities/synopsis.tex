Project management was the focus for our group in a sixth semesterâ€™s multiproject, where we worked on  apps for children with autism over the course of 4 sprints. This report details the overall structure of the project along with our work as product owners for a division of the overall project. Our contributions vary from managing the Google Play and Google Analytics aspects of an app, the renaming process of apps across a large developer environment, mapping dependencies between apps and libraries, and maintaining a backlog for the Scrum process. Our efforts bettered knowledge-sharing and improved the workflow for the build process of Giraf.
