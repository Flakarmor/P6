The main goal of this sprint was to handle the renaming of most apps and some of the libraries, as well as ensuring that the various guides used in the project was available on Redmine in a readable format. However many of the tasks proved to be easier than estimated and were finished early, so we added the core library to our sprint backlog.\\
