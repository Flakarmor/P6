\section{Release Backlog} \label{Sprint3_SecReleaseBacklog}
\textit{This section will deal with the user stories regarding the release of a backlog for sprint 1 and 2.}

%Introduction + motivation?
We were tasked with making a release backlog for the Build \& Deploy subproject as a part of the overall Scrum process and to be able to provide a better overview of what has been made during the semester. Being the product owners of Build \& Deploy, we were in a unique position to solve this user story.

In itself, making a release backlog is an almost trivial task. However, since the product owner role wasn't given till the second sprint, there had been done nothing to store any completed user stories and till this sprint, none had considered to start for this subproject.
Therefore, the challenge in making a proper release backlog lies in some data being lost or hard to retrieve without exhaustingly going through all the reports of the year or interviewing each group.

%What is a release backlog
A release backlog is a subset of the product backlog used for Scrum. The release backlog contains the user stories which were completed for a given sprint.
