\subsubsection{Standalone App or library}

In Table \ref{coreapp_corelib_comp} an overview is shown of the positive and negative aspects (pros and cons) of each solution. The two solutions were evaluated on how easy they would be for the user. This meant that the app-solution would be a bad solution because it would require the user to install another app in addition to the standalone app they wanted to use. The bigger size of the apps in the library-solution is regarded as a minor problem as currently the storage space for the pictograms used far outweighs the storage used by the installed apps.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline Core standalone App & Core standalone Library \\ 
\hline \textbf{Pros} & \textbf{Pros} \\ 
\hline Smaller in size when more than 1 standalone app is installed & True standalone (no other apps needed) \\ 
\hline \textbf{Cons} & \textbf{Cons} \\ 
\hline Another app needs to be installed & Bigger app size \\ 
\hline Other notes & Other notes \\ 
\hline Fusion Core standalone and Pictosearch (only 1 ‘plugin’ app) & Make Pictosearch part of the core library
(no ‘plugin’ app) \\ 
\hline
