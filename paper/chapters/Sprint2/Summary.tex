\section{Summary} 
\textit{This section is a short description of what we did in the 2nd sprint, and which user stories that followed over to the next sprint.}

\textbf{Dependency}:
We were given the task of finding dependencies for the apps and libraries, for this we found all the dependencies and listed them. To improve the overview of the dependencies we made a graph for app-library, library-library, and app-app dependencies. These graphs were shared with the rest of the project on a Redmine wiki page.

\textbf{Standalone}:
In the user story to make app standalone we started by finding out what functionality the apps would need to be able to function on their own. For this we found that we would need to make a library that included these functionalities, which is then included in all the apps.

\textbf{Build structure}:
When building apps in the project the build time was very long because all libraries were built recursively. To improve this we incorporated the use of AAR files in the build process. This lead to a change in the number of builds from an exponential number of builds, to a linear number of builds.\\

For the 2nd sprint we did not complete all the tasks that were assigned to us. The tasks we did not complete were for the standalone app and the making of a core library. These tasks were not finished because they proved to have a lot more work in them than first estimated. We continued working with the core library in the 3rd sprint, but postponed the standalone app since the app would require the core library before any more work could be done.
