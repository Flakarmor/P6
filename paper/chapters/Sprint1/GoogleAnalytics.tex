\subsection{Google Analytics}\label{Sprint1_SubsecGoogleAnalytics}
Google Analytics is a service created by Google. The service generates statistics from website traffic. Google Analytics main function is to track visitors and display advertising, to show the developer how people are using the product. Mobile App Analytics is a branch of Google Analytics, which focus on mobile apps. Mobile App Analytics has Google Play integration which allows for visitors/traffic sources tracking. this traffic can then be use to see who is installing the apps on which platform. Mobile App Analytics also provide some APIâ€™s for tracking events, Crash, Exception, and user patterns, to see how the users use the app.

Mobile App Analytics and Google play have a lot of the same functionality for tracking who installed what on which platform. But Mobile App Analytics has an advantages when it comes to crash/exception rapports, because APIs send a crash report directly to Mobile App Analytics, without the user has to do anything, where Google play do not include crashes that are not reported by users. For this reason Mobile App Analytics were used as the main crash report service.

For crash reporting there were three task at hand. the first was to automatically forward the crash reports for a submodule to the groups that worked on that submodule. The second and third task was to provide a guide on how to implement the API into the applications and to provide a guide for the next years Google Analytics group on how to auto-forward crash reports.

\subsubsection{Autoforward crash reports}
Mobile App Analytics has a built-in Email feature, which allow the user to automatically email a crash report daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly. It is not that intuitive how to auto forward reports because the user has to first make an report that a able to filter to the time interval the user wants. Therefore an guide was made which can be found in appendix \ref{ChapCrashReport}.

\subsubsection{Mobile App Analytics API}
The Crash API for Mobile App Analytics has to be implemented if crashes are to be fund. The API makes it possible to make a Tracker which can be used to report information to Mobile App Analytics, when an exception is caught. An great feature about the tracker is that it can be set to report uncaught exception.
