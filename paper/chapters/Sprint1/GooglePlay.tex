\subsection{Google Play}
Google Play is a digital distribution platform created by Google. It is used as an appstore for android devices as well as for music and e-book distribution. Because we in the project are making an apps for android devices, we are using the Google Play store to distribute the different apps. \\

As it was our responsibility to maintain and control Google Play for this semester, we started by familiarize us with the different features that Google Play provides. We found that Google Play provides a lot of statistics for all the apps, like how many times the app has been installed and how many are still using it. Like having access to statistics, Google Play also allowed os to change with apps should be shown on the store and to change the descriptions for the apps. One thing we noticed when we looked at some of the description was that a lot of the descriptions was very short and did not provide enough information about the apps for the user to know what functionality the apps provided. Because of this we decided to update some of the descriptions, make an English version, and to update some of the pictures provided for the user.
