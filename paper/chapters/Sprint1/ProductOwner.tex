\section{Product Owner} \label{Sprint1_SecProductOwner}
For the first sprint we took on the role as product owner B\&D. This meant that we were responsible for receiving requests and requirements from the groups in GUI and DB. It was then our job to form new user stories based on the requirements. We were also the ones who handled the sprint end and the planning of the next sprint.

In the first sprint we did only got a few request and requirements but this was probably because a lot of the time  allocated to the first sprint was used to get knowledge about the project. We decided to keep the role as product owners for B\&D during the next sprint.
