\section{Summary} 
\textit{This section is a short description of what we did in the 1st sprint, and which user stories that followed over to the next sprint.}\\

The main goal of the 1st sprint was to get familiar with how the overall structure of the project was. 

\textbf{Google Play and Analytics}
As it was our responsibility to handle everything related to Google Play and Analytics we first familiarized ourselves with them. For Google Analytics we wrote a guide on how to implement the code to get crash reports on Google Analytics, and made it so that Google Analytics auto forwarded crash reports to all groups that were interested in getting them. For Google Play we updated all the descriptions and made a english translation for the apps, and in cooperation with group 9 we made it so that when an app is build on the Jenkins server the app is released as an alpha version on Google Play.

\textbf{Central dokumentation}
For code documentation we first did some research to get to know how to use it. After that we then wrote a guide on how to implement the code documentation in the individual apps, which was shared on the Redmine wiki.


For the first sprint we completed all the user stories that were assigned to us, but as Google Play, Google Analytics, and Product owner was our roles, we continued working with them in the 2nd sprint.
