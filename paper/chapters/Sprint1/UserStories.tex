\section{User Stories and Tasks} \label{Sprint1_SecUserStoriesAndTasks}
\textit{This section describes the sprint planning for the 1st sprint.}

In accordance with normal Scrum practices, we started with a sprint planning session. It was held in collaboration with the other groups for our s-ppubproject B\&D, which consisted of group 2, 5, 8, and 9. One of the first things the entire project team, not only B\&D but the other subprojects as well, did in the project was to scour through the reports from last year's project and construct an initial backlog to work on for the first sprint.
After this, the user stories were divided between the relevant subprojects, and then later some of the user stories were divided between the different groups. On Table \ref{Sprint1_UserStories2_table} is a list of the user stories that was assigned to our group in the first sprint.

The main goal of the 1st sprint was to get familiar with how the overall structure of the project was.
