\section{User Stories and Tasks} \label{Sprint1_SecUserStoriesAndTasks}
\textit{This section describes the sprint planning for the first sprint.}\\
In accordance with normal Scrum practices, we started out with a Sprint planning session. It was held in collaboration with the other groups for our subproject Build and Deploy, which consisted of group 2, 5, 8, and 9, each containing 4 people. One of the first things the entire project team did in the project was to scour through the reports from last semester's project and construct an initial backlog to work on for the first sprint. Then, we split the user stories between the relevant sub-projects.

The main goal for this sprint, as reflected by the user stories, was to acquaint ourselves with the project and the Google services.\\
