\chapter{Conclusion} \label{ChapConclusion}
\textit{The conclusion has two aspects, one for the overall project, and one for our own work.}

Overall the project was in a more refined state than it was, when we started working on the project.
The apps now have a more consistent design in order to give the user the feeling that they are using a combined system and not ten different apps. The new design has not been implemented in all parts of the project, as not all apps were worked on during this semester.
The database is now able to synchronize between two tablets running the Giraf-system. This is still in an early state and is still not ready to be released to the customers. The synchronization is also still limited to text strings and not pictograms which is one of the end goals for the feature to be capable of.

As for our own work we have helped the overall project by improving the app build structure. This helped reduce the build time for the Jenkins server. Overall, the build time has been reduced from around 25-30 minutes when we started the project, to 5-10 minutes at the end of the project.
Internal renaming of the apps was done to make the app names consistent. The renaming was successful, but one of the apps did not work due to a dependency issue, which was not fixed. This means that all but one app has been renamed.

We have also done a lot of work as product owners for the B\&D subproject. We helped direct the work for the other groups in the subproject. Our work was also important in making of a combined backlog for the entire project. This backlog will give the students next semester a place to start their work without having to look through every student report from this semester as was done this year just to find unfinished user stories.
Our work as a whole was a success and a positive contribution to the project. Our work with the Scrum method fit in with the project nicely, but working in three subprojects caused some problems. Information was not always shared properly between the subprojects, which gave some issues along the way. On the other hand it was nice to have specialized groups that could focus on the more complex problems.
