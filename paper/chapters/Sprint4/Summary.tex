\section{Summary} 
\textit{This section is a short description of what we did in the 4th sprint, and which user stories that followed over to the next sprint.}\\

\textbf{App name consistency:}
We managed to make the app names consistent and understandable for all apps except for one, with was the “weekschedule” which instead got the name “ugeplan”, as by the time it could be renamed properly, the sprint was over.

\textbf{Guides:}
For the sprint we made a guide for the groups next semester. This included a guide for the use of Google Play and a Starter guide for how to install and run the basic tools in the project. In addition to making these guides we also made a document that described and referenced all the guides from the groups in the B\&D subproject.

\textbf{Pictosearch to library:}
In the sprint we made the final changes in making pictoseach into its own library, since the core library was discontinued and made it so that all the apps used the library instead of the service app version of pictosearch.

\textbf{App bundle:}
We found that Google Play do not support the use of app packages. Because of this it would only be possible to make one place where the user can get all the apps in one place by collecting all the apps into one, but this was decided to be postponed to next semester.\\

For the last sprint we finished all our user stories.
