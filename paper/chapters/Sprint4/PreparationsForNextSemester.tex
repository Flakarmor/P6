\section{Preparations for next semester}
\textit{For our role as product owner and our work with guide consistency, we took the task of preparing guides from B\&D for the next semester.}

To make it easier for next years semester to find the guides written in this semester, a document containing a list of guides description and a reference to the location of those guides were made. A full list of the guides can be found in Appendix \ref{AppendixGuides}.
In the same appendix the guides we wrote to help the next semesterâ€™s student can be seen in their entirety.
In addition the groups responsible for Jenkins and for the server were tasked with writing relevant guides for their work with those services, so it would be easier to start on the project next year.

The guides we were directly involved in writing and improving are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Google Analytics Guide
	\item Google Analytics Crash Reports to Email Guide 
	\item How to use Google Play
	\item Android Studio Setup
	\item App and library renaming in Android Studio
	\item How to implement the Pictosearch library
	\item Javadocs
	\item Dependencies Overview
\end{itemize}
