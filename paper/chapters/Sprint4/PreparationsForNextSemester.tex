\section{Preparations for next semester}
\textit{For our role as product owner and our work with guide consistency, we took the task of preparing guides from B\&D for the next semester.}

To make it easier for next yearâ€™s semester to find the guides written in this semester, a document containing a list of guides, descriptions of said guides, and a reference to the location of those guides were made. The list can be found in Appendix \ref{AppendixGuides}.
Some of the guides on the list were made by our group. Those guides can be found in the same appendix in the sections after the list.

In addition the groups responsible for Jenkins and for the server were tasked with writing relevant guides for their work with those services, so it would be easier to take over their work next semester.

The guides we were directly involved in writing and improving are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Google Analytics Guide
	\item Google Analytics Crash Reports to Email Guide 
	\item How to use Google Play
	\item Android Studio Setup
	\item App and library renaming in Android Studio
	\item How to implement the Pictosearch library
	\item Javadocs
	\item Dependencies Overview
\end{itemize}
