\textit{This section describes the sprint planning for the fourth sprint.}

As product owners for the B\&D subproject we facilitated the sprint planning for the fourth sprint for the B\&D groups. In Table \ref{Sprint4_secUserStories4_table} the user stories for our 4th sprint can be seen.

The main goal of the 4th sprint was to make the project ready for being taken over by other groups next semester.
There are some user stories that have bled over from sprint 3. These user stories were virtually completed but still requires some attention from us.\\
