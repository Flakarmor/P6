\section{Google Analytics} \label{Roles_SecAnalytics}
\textit{In this section we describe  the work we did regarding the role as those responsible for Google Analytics. Most of our work in the role of Google Analytics is described in Section \ref{Sprint1_SubsecGoogleAnalytics}.}

The implementation of Google Analytics was sporadic and only a few applications had it implemented. Rather than implementing it in all apps, we offered to set it up for any groups interested in getting crash reports. However interest was low and by the end of the first sprint, the advent of continuous integration testing on Jenkins effectively ended development using Google Analytics.
