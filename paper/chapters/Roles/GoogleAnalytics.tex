\section{Google Analytics} \label{Roles_SecAnalytics}
\textit{This section will discuss our role as responsible for Google Analytics.}

Most of our work in the role of Google Analytics is described in sec \ref{Sprint1_SubsecGoogleAnalytics}.

The implementation of Google Analytics was sporadic and only a few applications had it implemented. Rather than implement it in all apps, we offered to set it up for any group interested in getting crash reports. However interest was low and by the end of the first sprint and the advent of continuous integration testing on Jenkins effectively ended development on Google Analytics.
