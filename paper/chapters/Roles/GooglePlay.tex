\textit{This section will discuss our role as responsible for Google Play.}

As the group responsible for Google Play we have maintained the store page for all the apps in the Giraf-project. This meant that we made updates to the descriptions of the apps, ensured the right versions were promoted from alpha-versions, that were automatically uploaded, to the production-versions, the official versions that everyone visiting Google Play can see.

Our daily work with Google Play consisted mostly of being available if other groups needed our help with anything related to Google Play. In the 3rd sprint we did have a minor, urgent task, as Google had made new rules regarding the content-classification, which required us to fill out their new format, otherwise Google held the right to remove the apps from Google Play.

Most other work have been minor tasks of providing the Jenkins group with information about the current version codes of the apps, so they could auto-upload the alpha-versions.

As described in Section \ref{Sprint3_name} we also uploaded essential new apps because of the way the renaming had to be done. This gave a few issues because of stupid spelling mistakes and last second changes, but they were easily resolved.
