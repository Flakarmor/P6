\chapter{App and library renaming in Android Studio}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Open the app or library project in Android Studio
	\item Under src --> main --> java the path shown is dk.aau.cs.giraf.CurrentName
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Rightclick above path and under refactor click rename and change CurrentName to NewName.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item After renaming the above, press Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) and search for giraf.CurrentName and replace it with giraf.NewName.
	\item In case the app or library calls other apps or libraries that are being renamed, then do step 3 again for each case, replacing CurrentName and NewName with the ones from the app or library being called.
	\item Commit the changes to Git and Jenkins will attempt to build it.
