\section{Collaboration between product owners}
\textit{This section covers the collaboration work done between the three product owner groups.}

As there were three groups that were product owners in the project, some of the tasks and information were shared in between us. This included user stories, tasks, and the information related to sprint planning and sprint ends.

\subsection{Sprint ends and sprint planning}
During each sprint a number of user stories were given to the product owners, but it was not always the correct subproject that received the right user stories. Therefore, we planned meetings with the other product owners in between each sprint end and the next sprint planning, where we shared the user stories we had, and discussed if there were any other user stories that were needed or if a user story was ambiguous and needed to be reformulated. We then distributed the user stories to the backlog for the subproject they belonged to, so the user stories were ready to be presented at the sprint planning for that subproject.

\subsection{Product backlog and release backlog}
Since all product owners were responsible for making a backlog and a release log for the user stories, we worked together and collected them all in one document. This required that all the user stories were formulated in a similar way and that at least one from each group needed to be present, so all user stories for the three subprojects were included in the document.

In the process of making the document our group was the main contributor, in the sense that it was our responsibility to make the pdf document that should be included on the Redmine wiki page, for the next semesterâ€™s students. The backlog can be found in Appendix \ref{Appendix_secBacklog}.
